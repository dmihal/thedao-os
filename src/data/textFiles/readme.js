      Hi, this is a small recreation of a Windows 98 Desktop.
      I developed a component library just to learn some browser stuff and this seemed like the best way to test it out<br/>
      The focus was on trying to capture the feel of my own personal computer circa 2000-2002 (terrible monitor included) rather than a straight copy of Windows 98 so theres's some big differences. Lemme know if you find any bugs!

          <li>What's that annoying flicker?<br>I added a CRT effect, you can disable it via Start -> Settings -> Control Panel</li>
          <li>Why the weird screen size?<br>
            On desktop I'm trying to match up with my old monitor, basically everyone used a 4:3 resolution back then too, you can change this in the control panel too<br/>
            On mobile, 100vh results in an annoying scroll on some browsers that clashes like crazy with the dragging and droppig.

          <li>Paint is broken<br/>I know, it's poc and isn't something I want to work on improving atm</li>
          <li>Can I delete files?<br /> Not yet, unless you delete local storage</li>
          <li>The launch screen was cool, can I play it again?<br/>Yep, you'll have to go through the shut down screen first though</li>
          <li>Why that background as default?<br />I plan on changing this often enough</li>

        This site is built with React 16 (pre-hooks, I have my reasons).<br />
        State management is handled via React's Context API, as I never worked with it before I need to do a huge refactoring of dumb bits hanging around.<br />
        'react-rnd' was used extensively to manage windows.<br />
        Limited tests are done on the context functions and Cypress will be used to ensure core operations work okay.<br/>
        System storage is currently handled via localStorage<br/>
        Whilst minesweeper, skifree and paint are included here, they are quite lazily chucked in iframes that serve only as a proof of concept<br/>
        @TODO Add list of concessions to work on mobile
        @TODO thorough documentation of internal API following refactoring is needed
